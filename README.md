## 🗄️ Vector Database Implementation

### Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to handle high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. In the context of this Digital AI Strategy course, vector databases serve several critical purposes:

- **Semantic Search**: Enable finding conceptually similar content rather than just keyword matches
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Power the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to provide contextually relevant answers
- **Course Material Organization**: Store and index course content for intelligent querying and exploration
- **Scalable Information Access**: Handle large volumes of educational content efficiently

The implementation uses **ChromaDB**, a popular open-source vector database, combined with **HuggingFace embeddings** to create a sophisticated retrieval system for course materials.

### How Vector Embeddings Work

Vector embeddings transform text content into numerical representations (vectors) that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts end up close together in vector space, enabling:

1. **Semantic similarity matching** - Find related concepts even with different wording
2. **Context-aware retrieval** - Understand the meaning behind queries
3. **Efficient similarity search** - Quickly find relevant course materials

### Current Implementation Overview

The application uses the following vector database setup:

- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (HuggingFace Sentence Transformers)
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB with local persistence
- **Storage Location**: `./Week_5_1Oct2025/` directory
- **Retrieval Method**: Similarity search with top-k results (k=5)

### Step-by-Step Guide: Generating Vector Embeddings

#### 1. Prepare Your Course Content

```python
# Example: Prepare documents for embedding
from langchain.schema import Document

# Your course materials as text chunks
course_materials = [
    "The three main product-to-platform transformation methods are Launchpad, Accelerator, and Blueprint...",
    "Network effects lead to exponential growth by increasing value with each new user...",
    "Platform governance is key to mitigating risks from third-party developers and sellers...",
    # Add more content
]

# Convert to Document objects
documents = [
    Document(page_content=content, metadata={"source": f"chunk_{i}"})
    for i, content in enumerate(course_materials)
]
````

#### 2\. Initialize the Embedding Model

```python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

# Initialize the same embedding model used in the application
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    model_kwargs={'device': 'cpu'},  # Use 'cuda' if GPU available
    encode_kwargs={'normalize_embeddings': True}
)
```

#### 3\. Create and Populate the Vector Database

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

# Create new vector database
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=documents,
    embedding=embedding_model,
    persist_directory="./your_course_vectordb"
)

# Persist the database to disk
vectorstore.persist()
```

#### 4\. Test the Vector Database

```python
# Test similarity search
query = "What are the risks of inviting third-party sellers?"
results = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)

for i, doc in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Result {i+1}: {doc.page_content[:100]}...")
```

### Setting Up and Configuring the Vector Database

#### Option 1: Using the Pre-built Database

The repository includes a pre-built vector database in the `Week_5_27Oct2025` directory. To use it:

1.  Ensure the directory exists and contains the ChromaDB files
2.  Update the `PERSIST_DIRECTORY` variable in `DAIS_Week5_RAG.py`:
       `python    PERSIST_DIRECTORY = "./Week_5_27Oct2025"    `
3.  Run the application - it will automatically load the existing database

#### Option 2: Creating Your Own Database

1.  **Prepare your content**: Organize course materials into text chunks
2.  **Install required packages**: Ensure you have all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3.  **Create the database**:

<!-- end list -->

```python
import sys
import pysqlite3
sys.modules["sqlite3"] = pysqlite3  # Required for ChromaDB compatibility

from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.schema import Document

# Your implementation here
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Load your documents
documents = [...]  # Your course content as Document objects

# Create vectorstore
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=documents,
    embedding=embedding_model,
    persist_directory="./your_custom_vectordb"
)
```

4.  **Update the application**: Modify `PERSIST_DIRECTORY` to point to your new database

### Configuration Options and Customization

#### Embedding Model Options

You can customize the embedding model based on your needs:

```python
# Option 1: Multilingual support
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"
)

# Option 2: Higher accuracy (larger model)
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
)

# Option 3: Domain-specific models
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/allenai-specter"  # Scientific papers
)
```

#### Search Configuration

Customize the retrieval behavior:

```python
# In the run_similarity_search function
def run_similarity_search(query):
    # Adjust k for more/fewer results
    results = vectorstore.similarity_search(
        query, 
        k=10,  # Return top 10 instead of 5
        filter={"source": "specific_topic"}  # Optional filtering
    )
    return results

# Alternative: Use similarity search with score threshold
def run_similarity_search_with_score(query):
    results = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(
        query, 
        k=5,
        score_threshold=0.7  # Only return results above similarity threshold
    )
    return [doc for doc, score in results if score > 0.7]
```

#### Database Configuration

Customize ChromaDB settings:

```python
# Advanced ChromaDB configuration
vectorstore = Chroma(
    persist_directory="./custom_vectordb",
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    collection_name="course_materials",  # Custom collection name
    collection_metadata={"description": "Digital AI Strategy Course Content"}
)
```

### Examples of Extending Functionality

#### 1\. Adding New Course Materials

```python
# Add new documents to existing database
new_documents = [
    Document(page_content="New course content...", metadata={"week": "5"})
]

vectorstore.add_documents(new_documents)
vectorstore.persist()
```

#### 2\. Multi-Collection Setup

```python
# Create separate collections for different course weeks
week1_vectorstore = Chroma(
    persist_directory="./vectordb",
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    collection_name="week1_materials"
)

week2_vectorstore = Chroma(
    persist_directory="./vectordb",
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    collection_name="week2_materials"
)
```

#### 3\. Metadata Filtering

```python
# Search with metadata filters
def search_by_topic(query, topic):
    results = vectorstore.similarity_search(
        query,
        k=5,
        filter={"topic": topic}
    )
    return results

# Usage
platform_results = search_by_topic("network effects", "Platform Strategy")
governance_results = search_by_topic("rules for third-parties", "Ecosystem Governance")
```

#### 4\. Hybrid Search (Vector + Keyword)

```python
from langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever
from langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever

# Combine vector similarity with keyword search
vector_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
keyword_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(documents)

ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[vector_retriever, keyword_retriever],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3]  # 70% vector, 30% keyword
)
```

#### 5\. Custom Similarity Metrics

```python
# Use different distance metrics
vectorstore = Chroma(
    persist_directory="./vectordb",
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    collection_metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}  # Options: l2, ip, cosine
)
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

1.  **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches for better performance
2.  **GPU Acceleration**: Use CUDA for embedding generation if available
3.  **Chunking Strategy**: Optimize text chunk size (typically 200-1000 tokens)
4.  **Caching**: Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation
5.  **Index Optimization**: Tune ChromaDB parameters for your use case

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: SQLite3 Compatibility

```python
# Fix for ChromaDB SQLite issues
import sys
import pysqlite3
sys.modules["sqlite3"] = pysqlite3
```

#### Issue 2: CUDA/GPU Issues

```python
# Force CPU usage if GPU issues
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""
```

#### Issue 3: Memory Issues with Large Datasets

```python
# Process in smaller batches
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(documents), batch_size):
    batch = documents[i:i+batch_size]
    vectorstore.add_documents(batch)
    vectorstore.persist()
```
